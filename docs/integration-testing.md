# Integration Test Procedure: Prompt Expert A/B Testing

## Overview
This document outlines the complete integration test procedure for the prompt-expert system, demonstrating end-to-end functionality from prompt creation through expert evaluation and PR recommendation.

## Test Scenario: Programming Prompt Evolution

### Objective
Test the prompt-expert's ability to:
1. Detect file changes in a PR
2. Compare baseline vs improved prompt versions
3. Use domain-specific expert evaluation (programming)
4. Generate comprehensive A/B test report
5. Provide actionable PR recommendations

## Test Procedure

### Phase 1: Setup Baseline (Dumb Prompt)

#### Step 1.1: Create Initial Prompt File
Create a basic, poorly structured programming prompt:

**File**: `prompts/code-generator-baseline.md`
```markdown
# Code Generator

Write code for me. Make it work. Here are some examples:

- Functions
- Variables  
- Loops

Make sure it runs without errors.

## Examples
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("hi");
}
```

That's it. Write good code.
```

#### Step 1.2: Commit and Push Baseline
```bash
git add prompts/code-generator-baseline.md
git commit -m "Add basic code generator prompt"
git push origin main
```

### Phase 2: Create Sophisticated Version

#### Step 2.1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b improve-code-generator-prompt
```

#### Step 2.2: Create Improved Prompt
Update the same file with a sophisticated version:

**File**: `prompts/code-generator-baseline.md` (same file, improved content)
```markdown
