# Integration Test Procedure: Prompt Expert A/B Testing

## Overview
This document outlines the complete integration test procedure for the prompt-expert system, demonstrating end-to-end functionality from prompt creation through expert evaluation and PR recommendation.

## Test Scenario: Programming Prompt Evolution

### Objective
Test the prompt-expert's ability to:
1. Detect file changes in a PR
2. Compare baseline vs improved prompt versions
3. Use domain-specific expert evaluation (programming)
4. Generate comprehensive A/B test report
5. Provide actionable PR recommendations

## Test Procedure

### Phase 1: Setup Baseline (Dumb Prompt)

#### Step 1.1: Create Initial Prompt File
Create a basic, poorly structured programming prompt:

**File**: `prompts/code-generator-baseline.md`
```markdown
# Code Generator

Write code for me. Make it work. Here are some examples:

- Functions
- Variables  
- Loops

Make sure it runs without errors.

## Examples
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("hi");
}
```

That's it. Write good code.
```

#### Step 1.2: Commit and Push Baseline
```bash
git add prompts/code-generator-baseline.md
git commit -m "Add basic code generator prompt"
git push origin main
```

### Phase 2: Create Sophisticated Version

#### Step 2.1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b improve-code-generator-prompt
```

#### Step 2.2: Create Improved Prompt
Update the same file with a sophisticated version:

**File**: `prompts/code-generator-baseline.md` (same file, improved content)
```markdown
# Advanced Code Generator Prompt

## Role Definition
You are an expert software engineer with 10+ years of experience in multiple programming languages. Your task is to generate production-ready, well-documented, and thoroughly tested code.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Code Quality Standards
- **Readability**: Use descriptive variable names and clear function signatures
- **Performance**: Optimize for O(n) complexity where possible
- **Security**: Implement input validation and error handling
- **Maintainability**: Follow SOLID principles and design patterns

### 2. Language-Specific Best Practices
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use modern ES6+ syntax, async/await, proper typing
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, implement proper exception handling
- **Java**: Utilize streams API, implement interfaces, follow naming conventions
- **Other Languages**: Apply established conventions and idioms

### 3. Required Code Components

#### Error Handling
```javascript
function safeExecute(operation) {
  try {
    return { success: true, result: operation() };
  } catch (error) {
    return { 
      success: false, 
      error: error.message,
      stack: error.stack 
    };
  }
}
```

#### Input Validation
```javascript
function validateInput(data, schema) {
  if (!data || typeof data !== 'object') {
    throw new Error('Invalid input: data must be an object');
  }
  
  for (const [key, type] of Object.entries(schema)) {
    if (!(key in data)) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required field: ${key}`);
    }
    if (typeof data[key] !== type) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid type for ${key}: expected ${type}`);
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

#### Documentation Template
```javascript
/**
 * Brief description of what the function does
 * 
 * @param {type} paramName - Description of parameter
 * @param {type} [optionalParam] - Description of optional parameter
 * @returns {type} Description of return value
 * 
 * @example
