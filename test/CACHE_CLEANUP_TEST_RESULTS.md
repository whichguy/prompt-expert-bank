# Claude Cache Cleanup Test Results

## Test Date
2025-08-08

## Feature Implemented
Added the ability to delete test files from Claude's cache based on file IDs before running tests, ensuring clean state for each test run.

## New Capabilities Added

### 1. Delete Files by ID
```bash
node scripts/claude-cache-manager.js delete-ids . <file-id1,file-id2,...>
```
- Deletes specific files from Claude cache by their hash IDs
- Returns list of deleted files and any not found
- Updates cache index with deletion timestamp and reason

### 2. Delete Files by Pattern
```bash
node scripts/claude-cache-manager.js delete-pattern . <pattern>
```
- Finds and deletes all files matching the pattern in their path
- Useful for cleaning up test files
- Reports how many files were found and deleted

### 3. Cleanup in Test Scripts
The `run-context-test.js` now includes cleanup step:
- Checks for existing cache index
- Looks for test files by path pattern
- Marks them as deleted with timestamp
- Ensures clean state before test

## Test Results

### File Deletion by ID ✅
```
Input: 2f1f7be4dcc84c4ef924fe2dd2baf3988d5bb634
Result: Successfully deleted architecture.svg
Status: File marked with deletedAt timestamp
```

### File Deletion by Pattern ✅
```
Input: "processor.js"
Result: Found 1 file, deleted data/processor.js
Status: File marked with deletedAt timestamp
```

### Cache Index Structure ✅
Files are tracked with:
- `fileId`: SHA-1 hash of file content
- `path`: Original file path
- `type`: File type (text/image/pdf)
- `sentCount`: Times sent to Claude
- `deletedAt`: Deletion timestamp (when deleted)
- `deleteReason`: Why file was deleted

## Full Test Script Output
```bash
./test/full-context-test.sh
```
Successfully:
1. Cleaned existing test files from Claude cache
2. Created fresh test files
3. Calculated git blob hashes as file IDs
4. Tracked files in Claude cache (session: ecbf25c3f3193985)
5. Verified file IDs (d4d1b463..., 803e6323..., 2f1f7be4...)
6. Tested deletion by pattern

## Integration with Workflow

When the prompt-expert workflow runs:
1. **Before context loading**: Cleanup old test files by pattern
2. **Load context**: Fresh files with calculated hashes
3. **Track in cache**: Files marked with session ID
4. **Both threads**: Receive same file IDs
5. **After evaluation**: Can cleanup if needed

## Commands Summary

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Delete specific files
node scripts/claude-cache-manager.js delete-ids . abc123,def456

# Delete by pattern
node scripts/claude-cache-manager.js delete-pattern . "test/"

# Clean old sessions
node scripts/claude-cache-manager.js clean-sessions . 7
```

### Automated Cleanup
The workflow automatically cleans up files older than 14 days during the cache cleanup step.

## Key Benefits

1. **Clean Testing**: Each test run starts with clean cache
2. **No Duplication**: Prevents test files from accumulating
3. **Audit Trail**: Tracks when and why files were deleted
4. **Pattern Matching**: Easy cleanup of related files
5. **Session Management**: Groups files by evaluation session

## Verification

The system correctly:
- ✅ Identifies test files in Claude cache
- ✅ Deletes files by ID or pattern
- ✅ Maintains deletion history
- ✅ Preserves non-test files
- ✅ Updates cache index properly

Ready for production use with:
```bash
