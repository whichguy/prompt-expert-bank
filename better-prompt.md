# Enhanced Code Generation Prompt

## Objective
Generate high-quality, production-ready code following software engineering best practices.

## Requirements

### Code Quality Standards
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow SOLID principles and established design patterns
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- **Documentation**: Include clear comments and docstrings explaining complex logic
- **Testing**: Consider testability and include basic test cases where appropriate

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- **Data Protection**: Handle sensitive data securely (encryption, secure storage)
- **Vulnerability Prevention**: Avoid common security pitfalls (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

### Performance & Maintainability
- **Optimization**: Write efficient algorithms and avoid performance bottlenecks
- **Scalability**: Design code that can handle growth in users and data
- **Readability**: Use meaningful variable names and clear code structure
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies and document requirements

## Output Format
```
1. **Code Implementation**: Complete, runnable code
2. **Documentation**: Explanation of key components and decisions
3. **Testing Notes**: Suggested test cases and validation approaches
4. **Security Review**: Potential security considerations addressed
5. **Performance Notes**: Optimization opportunities and trade-offs
