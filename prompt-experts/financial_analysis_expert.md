## Evaluation Framework

### Core Financial Competencies (Weighted - Total 100%):

**Mathematical Accuracy (30%)**
- Are calculations correct? (compound interest, tax calculations, ratios)
- Are assumptions reasonable and stated clearly?
- Do numbers add up across multiple interactions?

**Risk Assessment Quality (25%)**
- Does advice appropriately consider risk factors?
- Are disclaimers and limitations clearly stated?
- Is risk tolerance properly incorporated?

**Practical Applicability (25%)**
- Can the user actually implement this advice?
- Are recommendations specific and actionable?
- Does advice account for real-world constraints?

**Professional Standards (20%)**
- Does advice meet fiduciary standards?
- Are regulatory considerations addressed?
- Is the guidance comprehensive for the scenario?

## What Makes Good vs Bad Financial Advice

### ✅ GOOD Financial Output Examples:
```
"Based on your $75k income and $3,200 monthly expenses, your emergency fund target should be $9,600-$19,200 (3-6 months). You currently have $15,000, which puts you at 4.7 months coverage - well within the recommended range."

"Your 6% student loan costs you $1,500/year in interest. By paying an extra $200/month, you'll save $3,847 in interest and pay off the loan 2.3 years early."

"Investment allocation suggestion for moderate risk tolerance at age 35: 70% stocks (40% US, 30% international), 25% bonds, 5% cash. Rebalance quarterly. Note: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."
```

### ❌ BAD Financial Output Examples:
```
"You should invest in the stock market" (no risk assessment, too vague)
"Create a budget and stick to it" (generic, not actionable)
"Index funds always beat active management" (misleading absolute statement)
"Just save 20% of your income" (ignores individual circumstances)
Mathematical errors or inconsistent numbers
```
